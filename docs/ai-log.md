# AI log – GREJ

A few lines a day about how AI was used: what for, which tool, and what worked or did not. This becomes the "Documentation of AI use" in the Result section of examensarbete.md.

- **Planning:** Claude Code reviewed the planning documents for gaps and contradictions between the files. The findings were useful, but the feedback was long and overwhelming, so we changed to shorter steps with one decision at a time.
- **Research:** Claude checked the free tiers of Render, Supabase and Stripe. This led to choosing Supabase for both the database and the images, since Render's free database expires after 30 days.
- **Workflow:** I commit before letting Claude change files, so I can review and undo its changes in the diff.

**Sprint 0:**

- **Database:** Claude Code set up EF Core with Supabase step by step, explaining each command. The secrets hook blocked Claude twice when commands only mentioned secret file names, which showed that the protection works. I set the connection string in User Secrets myself, so Claude never saw the password.

-  Claude Code set up Angular, CI with GitHub Actions, a Dockerfile, and deploys to Render and Vercel, one step at a time in plan mode. Claude checked new APIs (Angular 22's @Service, deprecated withFetch) in the installed packages instead of guessing. I set all secrets in Render and User Secrets myself.

- **Learning:** Since we were ahead of schedule, Claude Code ran short lessons on .NET (SDK, NuGet, solution and layers, middleware and DI) with comparisons to JavaScript and Laravel, and quiz questions. Answering "I don't know" showed what to go over again.
- **Verification:** Claude checked the Stripe CLI login with a harmless read command instead of reading the config file. It also found that an older .NET SDK 9 on PATH cannot build our `.slnx` solution.
