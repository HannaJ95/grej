- **Planning:** Claude Code reviewed the planning documents for gaps and contradictions between the files. The findings were useful, but the feedback was long and overwhelming, so we changed to shorter steps with one decision at a time.

- **Workflow:** I commit before letting Claude change files, so I can review and undo its changes in the diff.

I set the connection string in User Secrets myself, so Claude never saw the password.
